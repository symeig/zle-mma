# ZLE (Symbolic Eigenvalue Calculation for Integer Linear Eigenvalues)


## Setup

This repository also has a Dockerized environment available for getting running quickly. 
1. Determine your base directory by running $UserBaseDirectory in the Mathematica environment
   
2. From your installation location, copy lib.wl to a place where Mathematica can find it
  - mkdir yourbasedirectory/applications/lib
  - cp lib.wl yourbasedirectory/applications/lib
    
3. Generate matrices and compute eigenvalues by running .nb scripts in your Mathematica folder!
